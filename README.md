# SQL-Query

Welcome to the SQL Query Practice Repository! This repository is designed to help you strengthen your SQL query skills by providing a collection of common and interview-based SQL queries for practice.

## Introduction

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. Proficiency in SQL is highly valued in the tech industry, particularly for data analysis, database management, and software development roles.

This repository serves as a valuable resource for both beginners and experienced SQL users, offering a wide range of query examples to enhance your understanding and problem-solving capabilities.

## Features

- **Common SQL Queries**: Browse through a curated collection of commonly used SQL queries. These queries cover various aspects of database management, including data retrieval, filtering, sorting, aggregation, and more.

- **Interview Queries**: Prepare for SQL-based job interviews by exploring a set of carefully selected interview-based SQL queries. These queries simulate real-world scenarios and challenge your problem-solving skills.

- **Practice**: Put your SQL skills to the test! Take advantage of the query files provided in this repository to practice and refine your abilities. Work through the queries, experiment with different approaches, and strive for efficient and elegant solutions.

**2) Some of The Most Important SQL Commands**

1. **SELECT**:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

2. **INSERT**:
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
```

3. **UPDATE**:
```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

4. **DELETE**:
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

5. **CREATE TABLE**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
  column1 datatype,
  column2 datatype,
  ...
);
```

6. **ALTER TABLE**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD column_name datatype;
```

7. **DROP TABLE**:
```sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

8. **JOIN**:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

9. **GROUP BY**:
```sql
SELECT column1, COUNT(*)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1;
```

10. **ORDER BY**:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 ASC/DESC;
```

11. **HAVING**:
```sql
SELECT column1, COUNT(*)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

12. **DISTINCT**:
