**1) Top 7 most common SQL commands tested during SQL interviews:**

-   ```SELECT``` - used to select specific columns from a table
-   ```FROM``` - used to specify the table that contains the columns you are SELECT’ing
-   ```WHERE``` - used to specify which rows to pick
-   ```GROUP BY``` - used to group rows with similar values together
-   ```HAVING``` - used to specify which groups to include, that were formed by the GROUP BY clause.
-   ```ORDER BY``` - used to order the rows in the result set, either in ascending or descending order
-   ```LIMIT``` - used to limit the number of rows returned

**But what else it can do ?**

-   SQL can execute queries against a database
-   SQL can retrieve data from a database
-   SQL can insert records in a database
-   SQL can update records in a database
-   SQL can delete records from a database
-   SQL can create new databases
-   SQL can create new tables in a database
